  <figcaption><p>Hey all, we want to invite all our wonderful Soup Kitchen volunteers to a tea (and goodies!) afternoon on Friday, November 22nd from 2 to 4ish p.m.</p>
    <p>Rose will also have some information set out on a table in case you wanted to know about food safety courses, the AED location that we have at the church, naloxone and naloxone nasal spray; just in case you were wondering about these things!</p>
    <p>We hope everyone can join us at some point in the afternoon to enjoy each other's company!</p>
    <p>Please pass this along to your volunteers.</p>
    <p>Please RSVP so we have an idea of how many people to expect.</p>

    <p>
      The St. James lower Hall was in the flood area on Saturday night and therefore
      we will not be able to conduct a Soup Kitchen from St. James.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soup Kitchen got permission from Sagitawa to run out of the Ground Level Youth Centre
      in the interim. The location of the youth centre is <a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Ground+Level+Youth+Centre/@56.239392,-117.2966567,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x539645880f62dde9:0xb4b0f09bdac36b20!8m2!3d56.239389!4d-117.294468" target="_blank">north of the Co-op.</a>

    <p>Changes as of March 18th, 2020</p>
    <p>Volunteers for Soup Kitchen:</p>
    <p>
      We are changing our operation starting this Friday and until further notice. 
      Volunteers will prepare and handout BAGGED LUNCHES to patrons at the door. We are not inviting them in to eat. 
      However, if they want to come in and wash their hands and use the toilet, they can come in and use the facilities and 
      THEN receive their lunch bag on their way out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Volunteers are asked to wipe down and clean the bathrooms after soup kitchen. 
      I will post this announcement in the kitchen for reference. I will also have the list of things that go into the bags. 
      (We are in experiment mode right now as we figure out what goes in the bags.) PLEASE keep a count, as we may have to 
      increase our number of sandwiches. If there is LEFT-OVER sandwiches or lunch bags will go to Margaret Davie who will hand them 
      out at the Salvation Army on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any suggestions or questions, please contact Wanda Laurin (<a href="mailto:wlaurin@telusplanet.net">wlaurin@telusplanet.net</a>). </p>

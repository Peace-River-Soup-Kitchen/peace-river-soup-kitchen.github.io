<h5>Tax Receipt Required</h5>

<p>We are  presently working hard doing the paperwork to incorporate the Peace River Community Soup Kitchen 
  as its own society, which will be an official committee  to receive our own charitable status. Once we get 
  our confirmation we will be able to send out tax receipts for hopefully as soon as the 2021 year.</p>
